        Outpost provides the assessor with a mobile “pilots eye view” to
        efficiently streamline field inspections, data collection, and review
        activities. Outpost supplements core RPS data editing with a wide range
        of imaging, sketch and GIS links and features. Assessors no longer have
        to pull and carry property record cards for reference in the field.
        Conversely, real time Outpost to V4 data and photo uploads, eliminate
        the need for data entry from memory or hand written notes when you
        return to the office.

        New powerful and affordable tablet PC’s serve as the mobile device best
        suited for SDG Outpost technology. Please note that the Outpost browser
        based network architecture is open to any web connected mobile device
        including smartphones. However, field trials have proven the tablet to
        be the optimal device for efficient and effective field assessment
        activities.

        A 10.1” tablet display provides for robust 24×7 parcel and geographic
        visualization (snapshots) of your immediate surroundings from anywhere
        in your jurisdiction. The friendly Outpost user interface has been
        developed using Microsoft.NET technologies and has been optimized for
        tablet PC use. Through .NET, the Outpost system architecture is both
        flexible and extensible. As new mobile hardware options become
        available, the SDG development team can modify Outpost to incorporate
        rapidly evolving mobile technologies. Likewise, the Outpost program can
        be “re-fitted” for use in future upgrades to the RPS system.
